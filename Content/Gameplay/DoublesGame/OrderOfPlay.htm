            <MadCap:keyword term="Doubles Game" />Order of play, serving and receiving</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Players must hit the ball. For example, if A is paired with B, X is paired with Y, A is the server and X or Y is the receiver. The order of play shall be A→X or Y &amp; B→X or Y &amp; vice versa. The rally proceeds this way until one side fails to make a legal return and the other side scores.</li>
            <li>At each change of service, the previous receiver shall become the server and the partner of the previous server shall become the receiver. For example, if the previous order of play is A→X or Y &amp; B→X or Y, the order becomes X→B or A &amp; Y→B or A or X→B or A &amp; Y→A or B after the change of service.</li>
            <li>In the second or the latter games of a match, the game begins in reverse order of play. For example, if the order of play is A→X or Y &amp; B→Y or X at beginning of the first game, the order begins with X→A or B &amp; Y→A &amp; B in the second game depending on either X or Y being chosen as the first server of the game. That means the first receiver of the game is the player who served to the first server of the game in the preceding game. In each game of a doubles match, the pair having the right to serve first shall choose which of them will do so. The receiving pair, however, can only choose in the first game of the match.</li>
            <li>When a pair reaches 5 points in the final game, the pairs must switch ends of the table and change the receiver to reverse the order of play. For example, when the last order of play before a pair score 5 points in the final game is A→X→B→Y, the order after change shall be A→Y→B→X if A still has the second serve. Otherwise, X is the next server and the order becomes X→A→Y→B.</li>
