        <h1>Let</h1>
        <p>A Let is a rally of which the result is not scored, and is called in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ball touches the net in service (service), provided the service is otherwise correct or the ball is obstructed by the player on the receiving side. Obstruction means a player touches the ball when it is above or traveling towards the playing surface, not having touched the player's court since last being struck by the player.</li>
            <li>When the player on the receiving side is not ready and the service is delivered.</li>
            <li>Player's failure to make a service or a return or to comply with the Laws is due to a disturbance outside the control of the player.</li>
            <li>Play is interrupted by the umpire or assistant umpire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A let is also called if the ball hits the servers side of the table if the ball does not pass further than the edge. If the ball hits the table edge and hits the net, it is called a foul serve.</p>
