            <MadCap:keyword term="Scoring" />Scoring</h1>
        <p>A point is scored by the player for any of several results of the rally:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The opponent fails to make a correct service or return.</li>
            <li>After making a service or a return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly before being struck by the opponent.</li>
            <li>The ball passes over the player's court or beyond his end line without touching his court, after being struck by the opponent.</li>
            <li>The opponent obstructs the ball.</li>
            <li>The opponent strikes the ball twice successively. Note that the hand that is holding the racket counts as part of the racket and that making a good return off one's hand or fingers is allowed. It is not a fault if the ball accidentally hits one's hand or fingers and then subsequently hits the racket.</li>
            <li>The opponent strikes the ball with a side of the racket blade whose surface is not covered with rubber.</li>
            <li>The opponent moves the playing surface or touches the net assembly.</li>
            <li>The opponent's free hand touches the playing surface.</li>
            <li>As a receiver under the expedite system, completing 13 returns in a rally.</li>
            <li>The opponent that has been warned by the umpire commits a second offense in the same individual match or team match. If the third offence happens, 2 points will be given to the player.[38] If the individual match or the team match has not ended, any unused penalty points can be transferred to the next game of that match.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points unless both players score 10 points, when the game shall be won by the first player subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. A match shall consist of the best of any odd number of games.[39] In competition play, matches are typically best of five or seven games.</p>
