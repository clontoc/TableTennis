        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Offensive Strokes" />Loop</h3>
        <p>Perfected during the 1960s,[4] the loop is essentially the reverse of the speed drive. The racket is much more parallel to the direction of the stroke ("closed") and the racket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large amount of topspin. A good loop drive will arc quite a bit, and once striking the opponent's side of the table will jump forward, much like a kick serve in tennis.</p>
